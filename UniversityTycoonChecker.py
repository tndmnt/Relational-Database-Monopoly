# DATA70141 Checker
# v3: October 2024
# Tom Carroll
#
####### What is it? #####
# This will help you decide if your SQL filesfor submission are named correctly, 
# and that the changes made by your queries are visible for marking.
# It will NOT tell you if you have the correct output!
#
###### How do I run it? #####
# Place this file in the same directory as your SQL files.
# In your terminal, issue the following command: "python3 UniversityTycoonChecker.py"
# You may need to also run "pip3 install sqlite3"
#
# This script is a reduced functionality version of my marking script, which I will use
# to run your SQL files and determine if the databse functions as required. 
# The marking script I will use is based on this checker script, and has many extra features, such as unit testing 
# and examination of files and the state of the database.
# Basically.... if this checker script can read your files, execute your SQL, and show the state of the database, 
# then the automated marking will work.
# However, I will also use manual examination of your files, aswell as manual examination of the datanbase, 
# if this is needed.
